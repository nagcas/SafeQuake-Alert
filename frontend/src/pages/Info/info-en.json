    "title": "What are earthquakes?",
    "content": "Earthquakes are sudden vibrations or tremors of the ground caused by movements of the Earth's tectonic plates. These movements can be triggered by various factors, such as the release of accumulated energy along geological faults. Seismology is the scientific study of earthquakes and the seismic waves that propagate through and around the Earth."
  },
  {
    "title": "The causes of earthquakes",
    "content": "Most earthquakes are caused by friction between tectonic plates. When these plates move, they can become stuck and accumulate stress. When the stress exceeds the frictional force, a sudden movement occurs, generating an earthquake. Other causes can include volcanic activity, cave collapses, and human activities such as mining."
  },
  {
    "title": "How are earthquakes measured?",
    "content": "Earthquakes are measured using two main scales: the Richter Scale and the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). The Richter Scale measures the amplitude of seismic waves, while the Moment Magnitude Scale considers the total energy released by an earthquake. The instruments used to record seismic waves are seismographs."
  },
  {
    "title": "Types of seismic waves",
    "content": "There are different types of seismic waves, including P waves (primary), S waves (secondary), and surface waves. P waves are the fastest and can travel through solids, liquids, and gases. S waves are slower and can only travel through solids. Surface waves propagate along the Earth's surface and are responsible for most of the damage during an earthquake."

  {
    "title": "Can earthquakes be predicted?",
    "content": "Currently, the exact prediction of earthquakes is impossible. However, scientists can estimate the likelihood of an earthquake in a given area based on historical studies and statistical models. Early warning systems can provide a few seconds of warning before seismic waves reach a location, allowing people to take protective measures."

  {
    "title": "Earthquake effects on the environment",
    "content": "Earthquakes can have devastating impacts on the environment, including landslides, soil liquefaction, tsunamis, and changes in river courses. These secondary events can cause further damage to infrastructure and human lives, making seismic risk management a priority for many communities."
  },
  {
    "title": "Seismic protection technologies",
    "content": "Seismic protection technologies include earthquake-resistant buildings, base isolation systems, and retrofitting techniques to improve the resilience of existing structures. These technologies can significantly reduce the damage caused by earthquakes and save lives."

  {
    "title": "What to do during an earthquake",
    "content": "During an earthquake, it is essential to follow some basic safety rules: take cover under a sturdy table, stay away from windows and objects that may fall, and do not use elevators. After the earthquake, check for gas leaks and injuries, and follow the instructions of local authorities."
  },
  {
    "title": "Real-time seismic monitoring",
    "content": "Real-time seismic monitoring uses a network of seismometers to detect and analyze seismic waves as they occur. This data can be used to provide early warnings and inform authorities and the public about the ongoing seismic situation."

    "title": "History of major earthquakes in Italy",
    "content": "Italy has been struck by numerous devastating earthquakes throughout its history, including the 1908 Messina earthquake, the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, and the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. Studying these historical events helps to better understand seismic risks and improve mitigation strategies."
